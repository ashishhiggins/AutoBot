Arena driver: a USB webcam on this computer (~2.5 m up) watches the whole arena, finds the robot
(a printed marker on its top plate) and drives it over Wi-Fi along the lanes of the official
competition floor (arena_spec.py) to any station or bay. Same UDP drive packets as follow_tape.py,
so the firmware (robot_main.ino) does not change.

One-time setup (the webcam must not move afterwards - if it moves, run --setup again):
  python arena_drive.py --make-tag          # robot_tag.png (print BIG, stick on the robot's top plate)
                                            # + floor_tag_10..13.png (lay them inside the blocks, at the
                                            #   positions it prints - they calibrate the webcam)
  python arena_drive.py --find              # shows each camera number - which one is the USB webcam?
  python arena_drive.py --setup --camera 1
      finds the 4 floor markers by itself: press Enter when all 4 are found.
      (no floor markers? press C and click 2 points on each side: SOUTH, EAST, NORTH, WEST)
      -> saves arena_calib.json. Check the last picture: the drawn blocks must sit on the tape.
  Measure the webcam height and put it in CAM_HEIGHT_MM (most accurate, esp. from overhead),
  and the floor -> marker height in TAG_HEIGHT_MM.

Run (put the robot in a lane, facing along it, at least 20 cm of free lane ahead):
  python arena_drive.py --car 192.168.1.50
      H     = heading test, do it once after setup: the robot drives forward a little, then turns
              right, so the script learns which way the marker faces and which way the robot turns
      1-6   = drive to station S1..S6 (stops on the docking square, pick side toward the alcove)
      D     = drive into the dispatch bay      7 / 8 / 9 = park in P1 / P2 / P3
              (practice floor without cut-outs, arena_spec.CUTOUTS = False: stop IN FRONT of the bay)
      SPACE = pause / go on     R = roam (old "stay between the lines" mode)     Q = quit
  add --record to save the run (pictures, every decision, arrival errors) in laptop/runs/

For a different (non-competition) floor set OFFICIAL = False: then setup asks for the arena size,
you click its sides and the tape, and the robot roams between the lines.
