# Pickup robot — full project context

Read this whole file before doing anything. It is the hand-off from a long claude.ai chat
in which the hardware, wiring, firmware, laptop software and 3D-printed parts were designed.

## 1. What this project is

A small 4-wheel robot for a competition, built by Ashish (software engineer: strong Java /
Spring background, newer to embedded). **Current phase (2026-10-07): one robot driving the
official lanes** with an external webcam (`laptop/arena_drive.py`, section 10b). The iPhone /
`follow_tape.py` setup below is the earlier phase.

### The competition (full handout: `problemstatementcontext.txt`, one folder above `pickup-bot/`)
"Autonomous Multi-Robot Order Fulfilment Under Congestion" (Infosys hackathon).
- **Fleet of exactly 3 robots** on a 3 x 3 m floor. A mock WMS (an HTTP/JSON order server on the
  venue LAN) streams orders: fetch the QR cube from station S1-S6, report the pick with the cube
  ID read from its QR code, deliver it to the dispatch bay DZ, report the delivery. Optional
  telemetry POST.
- **Floor** (fixed, `arena_spec.py`): 4 keep-out blocks of 120 x 120 cm set 20 cm in from the
  edge. Every lane is exactly 20 cm wide (a perimeter ring plus a cross) and robots can never pass
  each other. Alcoves are 20 x 10 cm cut into the blocks, with a 20 x 20 docking square in the
  lane. DZ is a 20 x 60 dead end and P1-P3 are 20 x 30 dead ends: drive in, reverse out.
  Official frame: cm, origin bottom-left, x east, y north, heading 0 = east, CCW.
- Robot max **15 x 15 cm, 20 cm tall**. The pick must reach **~10 cm sideways** from the docking
  square. At most **10 fiducial markers per team**.
- Scoring: throughput. Zero collisions, zero keep-out incursions, zero wrong cubes, NO deadlocks,
  fairness, self-recovery. Compute preference: edge device > phone > laptop.
- External webcam: the owner says it is allowed and mountable (~2.5 m up or overhead).
- Figure 1 (floor plan) = `arenaimg.jpg` next to the handout. `arena_spec.py` was checked against
  it on 2026-10-07: A top-left, B top-right, C bottom-left, D bottom-right. S3's alcove is cut into
  Block A (north of its square) and S4's into Block D (south). The earlier assumption had these
  backwards. Nothing is assumed any more.

### Test track
Red electrical tape laid as a square on large glossy white floor tiles (wheels slip at high
speed — rubber tyres / rubber bands help).

## 2. Hardware (what the owner actually has)

| Part | Details |
|---|---|
| Microcontroller | ESP32 DevKit V1 clone, 30-pin, ESP-WROOM-32, CP2102 USB chip, USB-C, AMS1117 3.3 V regulator. Arduino board: **"ESP32 Dev Module"** (`esp32:esp32:esp32`), Arduino-ESP32 core **3.x** (uses `ledcAttach` / `ledcWrite(pin, duty)`). |
| Motor drivers | 2 x TB6612FNG red breakout boards: **front** driver = front-left (A) + front-right (B), **rear** driver = rear-left (A) + rear-right (B). |
| Motors | 4 x N20 gear motors with hall encoders, 6-wire harness. Encoder board pad order: **M1, GND, C1, C2, VCC, M2** = **white, blue, green, yellow, BLACK, red**. Black is **VCC** on this board (not ground). Encoders powered from 3V3. Gear ratio / counts-per-rev unknown (label partly read "...00RPM"). |
| Battery | 2S Li-ion (2 x 18650, 7.4 V nominal, 8.4 V full) → fuse → switch → VBAT |
| Regulator | LM2596 buck, **set to 5.0 V** → ESP32 **VIN** and servo |
| Servo | TowerPro **MG90S** (180° positional, metal gear) for the pickup arm, signal on D2 |
| Battery sense | VBAT –100 kΩ– D34 –47 kΩ– GND (8.4 V reads ≈ 2.7 V). Optional: firmware handles it missing. |
| Camera | **iPhone**, rear camera, mounted on the robot, streaming over Wi-Fi with the **IP Camera Lite** app (HTTP MJPEG, needs login; default admin/admin; port 8081 in use). |
| Laptop | MacBook (macOS) — runs the vision script and Claude Code |
| Also owned / planned | ESP32-CAM (planned separate QR-reading node), Jetson Orin Nano Super (owned, not used in the current setup) |

## 3. Wiring — FINAL. The owner cannot change it now.

### ESP32 pins (board held USB-C at the top, chip facing you; names as printed on the board)

| Left side | Goes to | Right side | Goes to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3V3 | 3.3 V rail | VIN | 5 V from LM2596 |
| GND | GND | GND | GND |
| D15 | rear-right encoder C2 | D13 | rear driver PWMA |
| D2 | servo signal | D12 | not used (boot pin, keep free) |
| D4 | front-left encoder C1 | D14 | front driver PWMB |
| RX2 (16) | front-right encoder C1 | D27 | front driver AIN2 |
| TX2 (17) | rear-left encoder C1 | D26 | front driver AIN1 |
| D5 | rear-right encoder C1 | D25 | front driver PWMA |
| D18 | rear driver AIN1 | D33 | front driver BIN2 |
| D19 | rear driver AIN2 | D32 | front driver BIN1 |
| D21 | rear driver BIN1 | D35 | front-left encoder C2 |
| RX0 | USB serial — leave free | D34 | battery sense |
| TX0 | USB serial — leave free | VN (39) | front-right encoder C2 |
| D22 | rear driver BIN2 | VP (36) | rear-left encoder C2 |
| D23 | rear driver PWMB | EN | not used |

### Drivers (both identical except pins)
- Front: PWMA←D25, AIN1←D26, AIN2←D27, PWMB←D14, BIN1←D32, BIN2←D33
- Rear:  PWMA←D13, AIN1←D18, AIN2←D19, PWMB←D23, BIN1←D21, BIN2←D22
- Both: **STBY←3V3** (always enabled — GPIO4 is an encoder now), VCC←3V3, GND←GND,
  VM←VBAT, GND←battery −.
- Outputs: AO1/AO2 → front-left / rear-left motor (white M1 / red M2);
  BO1/BO2 → front-right / rear-right motor.

### Power
- Battery + → fuse → switch = **VBAT** → both drivers' VM, LM2596 IN+, battery-sense resistor.
- LM2596 OUT+ (5.0 V) → ESP32 VIN + servo red. OUT− → GND.
- ESP32 3V3 → STBY + VCC on both drivers + black VCC wire on all 4 encoders.
- **All grounds joined**: battery −, LM2596 IN−/OUT−, ESP32 GND, both GND pins on each driver,
  4 encoder blue wires, servo brown, 47 kΩ resistor.

### Pin gotchas
- D34, D35, VN, VP are input-only with **no internal pull-ups**; if a C2 on them never changes,
  add 10 kΩ from that pin to 3V3. D4, RX2, TX2, D5, D15 use INPUT_PULLUP.
- D2, D5, D12, D15 are boot-strapping pins. If an upload fails, unplug the servo signal from D2;
  if it hangs at "Connecting...", hold the BOOT button.
- In code: left wheels = motor index 0 (FL) and 2 (RL), right wheels = 1 (FR) and 3 (RR).

## 5. Firmware — `firmware/robot_main/robot_main.ino`

Compiles cleanly with esp32 core 3.1.1 (≈ 76 % flash). Not yet confirmed on the real robot
beyond the owner uploading it.

### What it does
- **Motors**: 1 kHz, 8-bit PWM. `setCommand(left, right)` with −255..255 per side.
- **Speed-up ramp**: `RAMP_PWM_PER_S = 1200` (≈ 0.15 s to full speed); stopping is instant.
  Set to 100000 for instant power.
- **Encoders**: interrupt on C1 (CHANGE), C2 read for direction, ISR uses direct register reads
  (`GPIO_IN_REG`), counts protected by a portMUX. `ENC_SIGN[]` only flips displayed counts.
- **Straight-drive assist** (`ASSIST`): **currently OFF by default (`ASSIST = false`) — the owner
  asked for it to be disabled.** Can be toggled at runtime (web page button, or UDP `assist on`).
  When on: if both sides get the same command, all 4 wheels are matched to the average encoder
  speed (learned per-wheel trims, zero-mean, separate forward/backward) and left/right travel is
  equalised (error measured in seconds of travel → no gear ratio needed). In turns, front/rear on
  each side are matched. Uses |counts|, so encoder sign doesn't matter. A wheel whose encoder stops
  counting is excluded (flag `ok` → 0) and copies its same-side partner's correction.
  Verified in a C++ simulation of mismatched motors: 26.7° drift over 3 s → under 1°.
- **Servo**: 50 Hz, 14-bit LEDC on D2, moves 1°/8 ms. Presets **not yet calibrated**:
  `ARM_STOW = 20, ARM_CARRY = 60, ARM_RELEASE = 72, ARM_REACH = 110` (servo degrees).
- **Battery**: D34 averaged; if < 6.4 V for 3 s → motors off (LOW BATTERY). If the divider isn't
  fitted the reading is ~0 and the cutoff stays disabled.
- **Fail-safes**: motors stop if no UDP command for 300 ms, or no web command for 1 s.
- **Wi-Fi**: station mode, `WiFi.setSleep(false)` (power saving adds lag), mDNS hostname `car1`
  (`car1.local`), prints `Ready. Web: http://<IP> ...` on Serial at 115200 baud.
  `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASS` are placeholders at the top — must be the 2.4 GHz network that the
  Mac and iPhone are on.

### Control interfaces
1. **Web page** `http://<robot IP>/`: hold ▲▼◀▶ (or keyboard arrows) to drive, speed slider,
   straight-assist toggle, reset trims, arm preset buttons, servo calibration slider, status box
   (battery, servo, Wi-Fi RSSI, per-wheel count / rate / pwm / trim / encoder ok).
   HTTP endpoints: `/cmd?c=f|b|l|r|s&s=180`, `/stop`, `/servo?a=90`, `/arm?p=stow|reach|carry|release`,
   `/assist?on=0|1`, `/trimreset`, `/status` (JSON).
2. **UDP port 4210**:
   - Drive packet = **8 bytes**: `'D','R'`, int16 left, int16 right (−255..255), uint16 seq,
     little-endian. Older/out-of-order seq numbers are dropped.
     (The `DR` header exists because the text command `status` is 6 bytes — the old 6-byte drive
     packet made `status` look like a random drive command.)
   - Any other packet = text command, reply goes to the sender:
     `stop` | `arm stow|reach|carry|release` | `servo <deg>` | `assist on|off` |
     `tele on|off` (10 Hz JSON telemetry to the sender) | `trim reset` | `status`.
   - Status JSON: `batt, low, servo, assist, cmd[2], rssi, pwm[4], cnt[4], rate[4], ok[4], trim[4]`.

### Over-the-air updates (added 2026-10-07)
- The firmware runs ArduinoOTA (port 3232, password from `secrets.h`).
  - `ArduinoOTA.handle()` is called ONLY while the robot is stopped (cmd and ramp all 0). The
    password check (PBKDF2, ~0.5-1 s) blocks `loop()`, which would otherwise leave the motors at
    their last PWM with the fail-safe frozen.
  - `onStart` → `stopNow()` and `otaActive`. `onError` → `stopNow()`, flushes the UDP drive
    packets queued during the update, and refreshes `lastCmdMs`. A failed update keeps the old
    firmware; a successful one restarts.
- **Motor watchdog**: an `esp_timer` every 50 ms cuts all 4 motors if `loop()` has not run for
  150 ms (any stall). `loop()` then calls `stopNow()` and waits for a fresh command, and the
  control-step `dt` is clamped to 50 ms so the ramp can't jump.
- `upload.py --ota`:
  - sends the robot `stop` first (the old udp_drive sketch would read `status` as a drive
    command, so never probe with it)
  - authenticates with `--auth=<pw>` as one token, masked in the output
  - `--ask-current` / env `OTA_CURRENT_PASSWORD` let you change the OTA password over Wi-Fi
    (log in with the old one, flash the new one)
  - reads the password ignoring comments (last `#define` wins)
  - firewall advice: allow espota.exe on Public AND Private (this PC's Wi-Fi is Public)
- OTA review (4-agent workflow, 2026-10-07) found these 6 issues; all are fixed.
- The Wi-Fi SSID/password and the OTA password now live in `firmware/robot_main/secrets.h`
  (`SECRET_WIFI_SSID`, `SECRET_WIFI_PASS`, `SECRET_OTA_PASSWORD`). The owner edits that file;
  never ask them to paste it.
- `python firmware/upload.py --usb COM5` (USB) or `--ota car1.local` / `--ota <ip>` (Wi-Fi),
  `--list`, `--compile`. It uses the IDE's bundled arduino-cli and the core's `espota.exe`, reads
  the password from `secrets.h` and masks it in its output. The FIRST upload with OTA in it must
  go over USB.
- Size with OTA: 1,028,534 bytes = 78 % of the 1.25 MB app slot (default 4 MB partition scheme,
  which has two OTA slots).

### Laptop hotspot (2026-10-07)
The owner can run the robot on this laptop's Windows Mobile Hotspot: the laptop is 192.168.137.1
and the robot gets 192.168.137.x. It is 2.4 GHz channel 11 because the laptop's own Wi-Fi is
2.4 GHz; set the band to 2.4 GHz in the hotspot settings and turn off "turn off when no devices are
connected". Find the robot by its Espressif MAC in `arp -a`, by `car1.local`, or by its serial
print. Confirm it with the text command `stop` (reply "ok stop"), not `status`.
- 2026-10-07: robot flashed over USB (COM3, CP2102) with the OTA + watchdog firmware. It joined the
  hotspot "DESKTOP-TEST" as **192.168.137.115** (MAC 8c-94-df-8b-93-40). `car1.local` does NOT
  resolve over the hotspot, so use the IP. Web `/status` and UDP both work.
  - Measured: RSSI −70 dBm; UDP round trip median 28 ms, 90th percentile 115 ms, worst 177 ms,
    10 % lost. The laptop's single Wi-Fi radio is shared between the hotspot and its own link to
    "i2web", which likely causes the spikes.
  - Battery reads 0.45 V: the sense divider sees no battery (switch off or not fitted), so the
    low-battery cut-off is inactive.
  - Windows hotspot quirk: it turned itself off when no device was connected (power saving).
    The ESP32 then waits in "Connecting to Wi-Fi...." (motors off) until it comes back.
- OTA over the hotspot: invitation and auth OK. The firewall first blocked espota's connect-back;
  the owner then allowed it (Public). Transfers then died at 7-85 % on the lossy link until
  `ArduinoOTA.setTimeout(10000)` was added. One OTA then reached 100 %, BUT the robot never came
  back on the network. On USB it was printing "ts.h" lines endlessly (the tail of the secrets.h
  warning?) with no ROM banner, even after an RTS reset. **Not explained yet. Watch serial over
  USB during the next OTA before relying on OTA.**
- Then (owner's request) the robot was switched to router **"NETGEAR37"** and flashed over USB.
  That firmware has the self-healing Wi-Fi (`connectWiFi()` retries every 10 s; `keepWiFi()` in
  `loop()` reconnects after 10 s lost). It boots cleanly, joins in ~3 s, and is at
  **192.168.1.3**. The laptop must be on NETGEAR37 too to reach it.
- **Current network (2026-10-07): "MiFi_021208"**, a mobile Wi-Fi router, 2.4 GHz. Flashed over
  USB. The robot joins in ~4 s at **192.168.43.93**. The laptop is on the same network.
  - Measured: RSSI −55 dBm; UDP round trip median 9 ms, 90th percentile 15 ms, worst 45 ms,
    0/60 lost. Much better than the laptop hotspot.
  - The robot is still on USB (COM3), which makes it the right moment to diagnose the OTA "ts.h"
    problem: send an OTA while reading the serial port.

### Live arena mapping with the real webcam (2026-10-07)
- The external webcam is camera **0** (DirectShow, 1920×1080); it is the only camera found. It
  sees the whole arena from just outside the near edge: all 4 red corners are in view, the 4 black
  blocks and the robot. No floor markers placed yet; the robot has NO ArUco marker yet (orange
  top plate).
- **Calibrated automatically from the red boundary**, without clicks. Red-pixel line fits per
  side (spread ~1 px); the faint far side was fitted column by column on "redness" R−max(G,B) ≥ 7
  (142 points, 0.3 px spread). Corners NW, NE, SE, SW = (534.7,124.4), (1312.2,148.5),
  (1808.1,739.3), (5.6,699.6) px. Near side = SOUTH (the floor is symmetric while there are no
  cut-outs). Saved as `laptop/arena_calib.json` (calibrated_by "red boundary lines (auto)").
- Webcam estimated from the rectangle: 1.34 m high, 1.24 m outside the south edge, HFOV 84°.
  CAM_HEIGHT_MM not set yet.
- Check against the tape: the black block tape is a median 0.8 cm from the official positions
  (worst 2.0 cm on the outer east/south edges); tile grout lines match the 60 cm grid to ~1 cm.
  **The practice floor matches the official dimensions.** The residual is taping tolerance plus
  some lens distortion; lens correction is still to do.
- **The camera is too low for the far half.** A 100 mm marker at robot height would look
  62×42 px on the near ring, 38×17 px at the centre, and 27×9 px on the far ring (~1.5 px per
  marker cell: unreadable). Raise it to ~2.5 m (or more overhead), then re-run this auto-mapping.
- `bot.py --host 192.168.43.93 status` works with the owner's normal Python (no OpenCV needed).
  OpenCV is still NOT installed there; my tests used the scratchpad venv.
- **Camera raised (owner: "around 210 cm"). Re-mapped automatically:**
  1. Rough corners come from the extreme endpoints of LONG red Hough segments. Taking extreme red
     pixels picked up a red object on a person outside the arena.
  2. Each side is refined by scanning across it for the reddest pixel at 200 points, then a
     RANSAC line fit (spread 0.3-0.9 px). It works around people standing in the arena.
  - Corners NW, NE, SE, SW = (615.4,124.8), (1416.4,178.0), (1723.8,1057.6), (222.3,917.5).
  - Tape vs official plan: median 0.2 cm, worst 1.6 cm.
  - The rectangle alone gives the camera 2.22 m up, 0.64 m outside the south edge, HFOV 84°,
    the SAME 84° as the independent first mapping. So `CAM_HFOV_DEG = 84` is now set; forcing
    2100 mm would imply 91°.
  - Saved in `arena_calib.json`.
  - A 10 cm mark now looks 55×56 px on the near ring, 38×28 at the centre and 29×17 on the far
    ring: readable everywhere.
- **Robot found by its yellow-orange TRIANGLE** (`ROBOT_MARK = "color"`; there is no ArUco
  marker on the robot):
  - HSV (9-32, ≥110, ≥100). The mark itself is hue ~15, S ~200; the red tape is hue 0-6.
  - Only inside the arena; plausible floor size 15-250 cm² (measured 74 cm²); triangle fill
    ≥ 0.55; prefers the patch nearest the last position.
  - The outline is un-warped to top-down at the mark's height. The direction comes from
    `minEnclosingTriangle`: the apex is the corner with the most equal sides (the triangle is
    WIDE, so "farthest point from the centre" picked a base corner).
  - Live, standing still: found in 34/36 frames, position ±0.3 mm, direction 87° ± 2° (it points
    north).
  - Frame rate was only ~4-5 fps. Cause: DirectShow ignores the MJPG request on this webcam and
    sends YUY2 1080p (USB-limited to ~5 fps). **Fix: `open_camera()` tries Media Foundation
    (CAP_MSMF) first**, which gives 30 fps MJPG 1080p. BUT MSMF with "hardware transforms" on hangs
    for minutes when opening. `arena_drive.py` sets
    `OPENCV_VIDEOIO_MSMF_ENABLE_HW_TRANSFORMS=0` BEFORE importing cv2; any test script must
    import arena_drive before cv2. The camera now opens in ~1.4 s at 27-30 fps.
  - About 2 % of frames picked the wrong triangle corner. Fix: `prev_heading` continuity: if the
    apex is > 60° from the last direction, take the corner that continues it. Live: 267/267 frames
    found, 0 frames > 20° off, wobble ~1°.
- The webcam DISCONNECTED twice after being raised: probably the long USB cable / extension.
- New CLI options:
  - `--auto-setup`: maps the arena from the red boundary with no clicks
    (`red_boundary_corners()`). It keeps the H test result if the corners moved ≤ 15 px and saves
    `auto_setup_check.jpg`.
  - `--auto H,S2,DZ`: presses the keys by script, each step when the previous one has finished. It
    stops at the first failure (non-ARRIVED, failed H test, or a step longer than 90 s), then quits.
    This is how Claude can run driving tests.

### FIRST REAL RUNS (2026-10-07, camera ~2.2 m, orange-triangle tracking, MiFi network)
- Battery: fine according to the owner. The sense divider is simply not connected (reads 0.44 V).
- **H test** (`--auto H`): forward 105 mm, turned +38° in the 0.4 s pulse (this robot turns slowly).
  Result: **robot front = triangle tip −176°** (the triangle points to the robot's BACK);
  turn_sign 1 (wiring normal). Saved in `arena_calib.json`.
  - The old H test turned the robot out in the lane (2.8 cm keep-out warning, correctly
    flagged). It is now forward → BACK → turn right → turn LEFT, so it ends where it started.
- **`--auto S2`** from (150,147) heading 260:
  - It reversed 3 cm to J150,150, turned 180° there (several pulses, ~4 cm pivot drift, at the
    junction so no harm), then REVERSED 60 cm down the lane to S2.
  - Lane keeping: max 1.2 cm, typical 0.6 cm off the centre line.
  - **Arrived 1.2 cm from S2, heading 90.7° (wanted 90).** Zero keep-out frames, robot seen in
    100 % of frames, 15 s in total.
- The run loop processed ~17 fps (the camera gives 30). Next optimisation: colour detection in a
  small window around the last position (it searches the whole arena box every frame, ~23 ms).
- **Run A (`--auto S4,S5,P1,S6,S3`) failed on its first turn** (`runs/arena-20261007-184134`):
  - It drove north from S2 to J150,150 with perfect lane keeping (x 149.1–149.6).
  - It turned 90° right there, but the reported position jumped 7.4 cm (149.6,149.4 → 152.0,142.4).
  - The first DRIVE east saw 7.6 cm cross-track → OFF LANE.
- **Cause: the orange triangle is not over the robot's turning point.** A circle fit of the
  triangle through each recorded turn (error ≤ 0.2 cm) puts the turning point about 3–4.6 cm
  BEHIND the triangle and 1–2 cm to its left, so the robot also stopped 4–5 cm short of every
  junction. The point differs by turn direction (right turns −46/−33 fwd, +20 left; left turns
  −23 fwd, +6 left, in mm): it also slides a little while it turns, more when turning right.
- **Fix (`arena_drive.py`):**
  - The pose is now the turning point: `mark_to_centre(mark, heading, arena.turn_centre)`.
  - `arena_calib.json` `turn_centre_mm` = {left: [fwd, left], right: [...]} mm from the
    triangle; the position uses their average. It is not reset by `--auto-setup`.
  - It is learnt by the H test (one turn each way) and refined after every TURN/FINAL TURN
    while driving (`fit_turn_centre`/`learn_turn_centre`, 30 % per turn; saved at quit).
  - Replaying the recorded turns, the apparent jump drops from 7.4 to 2.4 cm.
  - `log.csv` gains `mark_x_mm,mark_y_mm` (the raw triangle); x/y are the turning point.
- The Lenovo webcam was missing 4× today; Windows then lists it as "Unknown". At least the last time
  the owner had unplugged it on purpose; the earlier ones are unexplained. Check with
  `Get-PnpDevice -Class Camera`. USB selective suspend is ON on this laptop. If it does drop out
  by itself, turning that off is worth a try:
  `powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT 2a737441-1930-4402-8d77-b2bebba308a3 48e6b7a6-50f5-4782-a5d4-53bb8f07e226 0`
  then `powercfg /setactive SCHEME_CURRENT`. After replugging, run `--auto-setup` if the camera moved.
- **Run A, 2nd try (`runs/arena-20261007-185435`), with the turning-point fix:**
  - S4: ARRIVED, 1.3 cm off.
  - S5: ARRIVED, 4.3 cm off. The error is sideways drift on the last leg.
  - P1: OFF LANE. 96 keep-out frames over the run.
  - The turn fits now agree within about 1 cm whichever way it turns, so the left/right split is
    mostly noise. The average is about −33 mm fwd, +12 mm left.
- Three new problems found and fixed:
  1. **The camera-moved check froze the loop for ~0.45 s every 3 s.** That is longer than the 300 ms
     firmware fail-safe, so the robot stopped and started all the time (gaps visible in every
     log.csv).
     - It now runs in a background thread (`CameraCheck`): loop steps stay ≤ 70 ms meanwhile.
     - It must disagree `CAMERA_MOVED_N` = 3 times in a row before stopping the robot. A person
       walking over the boundary once caused a false "moved 36 px" stop.
  2. **The triangle's angle reads wrong by an amount that depends on which way it faces.** Travel
     direction vs measured heading on straight drives: facing east +5.5…+8°, facing north ≈ 0°.
     - So it drove slightly crabwise: 3–4 cm sideways drift on east/west legs, keep-out frames,
       and the S5 sideways error.
     - Fix: `heading_trim_deg` {E, N, W, S} in calib, interpolated by heading
       (`heading_trim`). It is learnt from every 15 cm of straight DRIVE (`learn_heading_trim`:
       a wheeled robot moves the way it points). Seeded E +6.5, N −0.3.
  3. **At the far (north) edge the triangle is ~20 px:** about 1 frame in 8 picks the wrong corner
     as the tip (heading 125 instead of 10). One such frame plus the turning-point offset → a
     7 cm jump → OFF LANE.
     - Fix: the run loop drops a detection that jumps more than 30 mm + 300 mm/s·dt or
       45° + 3 rad/s·dt from the last good one. After `JUMP_FRAMES` = 5 in a row it believes it.

### Building / uploading
- Arduino IDE: board "ESP32 Dev Module", port `/dev/cu.usbserial-…` or `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`.
- arduino-cli: `arduino-cli compile --upload -p <port> --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 firmware/robot_main`
  (`arduino-cli board list` shows the port; core: `arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32` with the
  Espressif index URL `https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json`).
- USB alone powers the ESP32 but not the motors — battery switch must be on to drive.
- Multi-robot plan: three identical robots on one Wi-Fi network → change `HOSTNAME` to car2, car3.

## 6. Laptop software (MacBook, Python 3, `pip install -r laptop/requirements.txt`)

### `laptop/follow_tape.py`
Camera → red-tape detection → PD steering → UDP drive packets at ~30 Hz.

```
python3 follow_tape.py --camera http://PHONE_IP:8081 --user admin --password admin --preview
python3 follow_tape.py --camera http://PHONE_IP:8081 --user admin --password admin --car ROBOT_IP
python3 follow_tape.py ... --record          # save the run for review (see section 8)
python3 follow_tape.py --find                # list camera numbers (Continuity Camera / webcams)
```
Keys in the window: **SPACE** start/stop, **+/−** speed, **Q** quit.

- **Camera input**: `--camera` takes a camera number or a stream URL (http MJPEG or rtsp).
  For http it handles **Basic and Digest login** (`--user/--password`, `user:pass@` in the URL,
  or auto-tries admin/admin), and if given only `http://ip:port` it opens the app's web page and
  finds the MJPEG link inside it (like a browser), then tries common paths. Always keeps only the
  newest frame (no lag build-up), auto-reconnects if the stream drops, shows a "Waiting for
  camera" screen with the reason. **Status: the owner confirmed the iPhone stream works with the
  login, using the back camera.**
- **Continuity Camera did not work** for the owner (OpenCV uses an AVFoundation path that recent
  macOS deprecates for Continuity Camera). Don't go back to it unless asked.
- **Detection**: frame resized to 320x180, HSV threshold for red (two hue ranges `RED1`, `RED2`),
  ignore top `ROI_TOP` = 35 %, split the rest into `BANDS` = 6 horizontal slices; each slice with
  ≥ `MIN_PIX` red pixels gives an x position (−1..1).
- **Steering**: err = 0.5·nearest + 0.5·farthest seen slice − `CAM_OFFSET`;
  turn = (KP·err + KD·d(err)/dt)·base; forward speed reduced by up to 60 % in bends;
  when no slice sees tape → **SEARCH**: spin toward the side where it was last seen
  (handles the 90° corners). Sends (0,0) if the camera freezes > 0.3 s.
- **Tunables (current defaults)**: `BASE_SPEED 170`, `MIN_PWM 95` (N20 stall), `KP 1.3`,
  `KD 0.02`, `SEARCH_SPEED 150`, `ROI_TOP 0.35`, `CAM_OFFSET 0.0`,
  `RED1 ((0,100,60),(10,255,255))`, `RED2 ((165,100,60),(180,255,255))`.
  Recommendation given to the owner: start around speed 130 (Wi-Fi camera adds ~0.1–0.25 s lag).
- Window shows camera view (left, green dots = tape per slice) and red mask (right).

### `laptop/bot.py` (UDP tool)
```
python3 bot.py --host ROBOT_IP status
python3 bot.py --host ROBOT_IP watch               # live wheel table
python3 bot.py --host ROBOT_IP drive 180 180 3     # drive 3 s, prints left/right count difference (< ~2 % = straight)
python3 bot.py --host ROBOT_IP arm reach           # stow|reach|carry|release
python3 bot.py --host ROBOT_IP servo 90 | assist on | assist off | trim reset | stop
```

### Network
iPhone, MacBook and ESP32 must be on the **same 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi**. IPs change between sessions
(an earlier network was 10.67.197.x); the robot prints its IP on Serial at boot; `car1.local`
works on most Macs, otherwise use the IP.

## 7. 3D-printed parts (`cad/`)

- Owner prints with **Bambu Studio** and needs **OBJ** files (mm, no unit conversion).
  PLA, 0.2 mm, 3 walls, 20 % infill.
- `pickup_bot_v2.scad` (current design, all parts collision-checked in CAD): compact stacked
  chassis, **145 x 130 mm, 141.5 mm tall** with the arm stowed.
  - Lower plate: 4 N20 motor slots (shaft hole + 2 x M1.6 + zip-tie slots + encoder clearance),
    2x18650 holder guides, LM2596 spot, flat **side panel the cube rests against** while carried
    (wheels don't stick out there).
  - Middle deck: MG90S mount (shaft down), slot for the scissor's sliding pin, standoffs for a
    70 x 90 mm perfboard (ESP32 + drivers), ESP32-CAM mast tilted 35° down toward the pickup side.
  - Top plate: 76 mm AprilTag recess (arrow = robot front).
  - **Side scissor arm** (lazy tongs, 4 cells, 38 mm links, driven by the MG90S) + **one-way hinged
    flap** at the tip: extend → flap rides over the cube and drops behind it → retract → flap hooks
    the cube and drags it against the side panel → carry → extend ~15 mm and drive away to release.
    First-link servo angles from CAD: stowed 77°, carrying a 50 mm cube 54°, full reach 23°
    (reach ≈ 108 mm past the side panel). Real servo values still need calibrating.
  - OBJ parts: 1_lower_plate, 2_middle_deck, 3_top_tag_plate, 4_camera_cradle,
    5_scissor_link (x7), 6_scissor_link_servo (x1), 7_tip_block, 8_flap, 9/10 spacers, 11_wheel (x4, 34 mm).
  - Hardware: M3 screws + nyloc nuts for arm joints, M3 for plates, M2 x 30 hinge pin, M2 servo screws.
- Earlier designs (superseded): a 90 x 140 mm basic chassis, and a 150 x 148 mm version with a
  rack-and-pinion slide + 2-finger claw. The owner's current physical chassis is his own print;
  don't assume it matches the CAD exactly.

## 8. Review-and-fix loop (how to help on this Mac)

You can't watch the robot live. Work in short loops:
1. Ask the owner for a recorded run:
   `python3 follow_tape.py --camera http://PHONE_IP:8081 --user admin --password admin --car ROBOT_IP --record`
   He presses SPACE to start, Q to stop. Each run goes to `laptop/runs/<date-time>/`:
   - `summary.txt` — duration, fps, % frames with tape lost, number/length of searches,
     avg/max steering error, settings used. **Read this first.**
   - `log.csv` — every frame: t, fps, state (FOLLOW/SEARCH/STOPPED/NO CAMERA), base, err
     (−1..1, + = tape to the right), seen (0–6 slices), L, R (PWM sent), band0..band5 x-positions.
   - `robot.jsonl` — ~10 Hz robot telemetry (pwm, encoder rate, battery, encoder ok flags).
   - `frames/*.jpg` — camera view + tape mask with overlay, 3/s and at every state change.
     Look at frames around problems (e.g. the first `_SEARCH` frames after a FOLLOW stretch).
2. Change one or two tunables at a time, explain why, and ask for another run.
   Typical reads: err sign flipping every few frames → lower KP / raise KD; tape lost at corners →
   lower BASE_SPEED or ROI_TOP (look further ahead); `seen` often 1–3 on straights → check the RED
   ranges against the mask half of the frames; wheel `rate` 0 while `pwm` > 0 → motor, wiring or
   battery problem; robot turns when told to go straight → motor wired backwards (swap white/red)
   or enable straight assist.
3. Firmware changes: edit, compile, upload over USB (section 5), and tell the owner what changed.

All of this was tested in the cloud chat with fake cameras/robots (MJPEG + login servers, UDP
robot simulator). **Nothing in sections 5–6 has been verified on the real robot except: the
owner uploaded the firmware and the iPhone stream connects with login + back camera.**

## 9. Decisions made (and why)
- Pickup on the **side** (not front/back): no turning needed at the docking square.
- **Drag, don't lift**: cube can't fall; one servo is enough.
- **Scissor arm + one-way flap** chosen over a claw (straight-line reach from a small body).
- **STBY → 3V3**: GPIO4 was needed for an encoder.
- **UDP** for drive commands (low latency, newest packet wins, 300 ms fail-safe).
- **Wi-Fi IP-camera app** instead of Continuity Camera (didn't work with OpenCV here).
- **Straight assist disabled by default** at the owner's request (code kept, toggleable).

## 10. Open items / next steps
1. First real runs of the tape follower with `--record`; tune KP / KD / BASE_SPEED / ROI_TOP.
2. Check every encoder counts (web page: turn each wheel by hand → its count changes, `ok`).
   If one wheel spins backwards: swap that motor's white and red wires.
3. Calibrate the arm presets with the servo slider and put the numbers in `ARM_*`.
4. A printed iPhone mount (landscape, ~40° down tilt, low and centred over the axles).
5. Later: ESP32-CAM QR reading; three robots (car1–car3) on one network.
6. Ask organisers: does the size limit apply while carrying the cube?

## 10a. Official-floor lane driving (2026-10-07) — `arena_drive.py` + `arena_spec.py` + `lane_follow.py`

With `OFFICIAL = True` (the default), `arena_drive.py` drives ONE robot along the official lanes to a
goal chosen by key: 1-6 = S1-S6, D = DZ, 7/8/9 = P1-P3. SPACE = pause / go on (re-plans from where
the robot is), R = old roam mode.
- `arena_spec.py`: the floor in official cm. Blocks, bays (drivable dead ends), alcoves, docking
  squares, `FLOOR_MARKERS` (ids 10-13 at (35,35), (265,35), (35,230), (265,230): near the outer
  block corners, inside blocks, clear of every bay and alcove). Spread out like this, 3 mm of
  placement error costs ~0.5 cm at the ring (the first, bunched positions cost 1.3-2.7 cm).
  Lane graph (Dijkstra `route()`, `route_from_point()`), `is_keepout()`, `keepout_depth()`
  (distance to the nearest lane strip / bay), `heading_for_pick()`, `goal_node()`.
  `python arena_spec.py` prints routes and saves `arena_spec.png`.
- **`CUTOUTS = False`** (in `arena_spec.py`, set 2026-10-07): the owner's practice floor has solid
  taped blocks, with no bays or alcoves cut out. Bays then count as keep-out and are not in the
  graph (19 nodes / 22 edges). Goals D and 7/8/9 stop at the bay's MOUTH on the ring
  (`goal_node()`). Stations work as normal. Set True once the cut-outs are taped.
- `lane_follow.py`: `Follower.go(x, y, hdg, goal)` then `update(t, x, y, hdg)` → (L, R, state)
  every frame. It turns on the spot ONLY at junctions and bay mouths: a 15 cm robot turning
  mid-lane sweeps 10.6 cm > the 10 cm half-lane. Otherwise it REVERSES:
  - at the start when facing the wrong way (only as far as the first junction)
  - onto a docking square when that puts the pick side (PICK_SIDE = right, from the CAD) toward
    the alcove (only from the last junction)
  - out of bays
  On a straight it steers with a heading term + cross-track term + yaw-rate damping
  (K_HEAD 0.35, K_CROSS 0.10, K_RATE 0.10; the earlier K_HEAD 1.5 oscillated with 0.13 s of lag).
  `go()` plans the direct route AND routes via every junction, and keeps the one with the fewest
  turns where there's no room (`grade()`), then the shortest (reverse cm count ×1.3). So
  "goal ahead but the dock needs the nose the other way" goes on to a junction, turns there and
  comes back. Starting > 6 cm off the lane is refused (OFF LANE). 3-6 cm off along the lane is
  driven back in by the cross-track term, with no sideways stub.
  - Turns over 35° go fast at PIVOT_PWM and stop early (learned `latency`). Smaller turns and stop
    corrections (NUDGE) are TIMED PULSES: how far a pulse moves doesn't depend on the delay, so
    they converge at any delay. The pulse gains learn: shorter after an overshoot, longer if it
    hardly moved, more PWM if pulses don't move it at all.
  - SETTLE waits until the robot is really still, comparing poses 0.25 s apart.
  - The straight-line stop delay `stop_lat` is learned separately, from stop over/undershoot.
  - After 8 tries a 2× tolerance is accepted; after 16 tries or 20 s → TURN FAILED (stop).
  - With the outer edge straight ahead at a junction, it aims 1 cm short (EDGE_SHORT_CM), so an
    overshoot can't swing it over the edge when it turns.
  `python lane_follow.py` = self-test. `simulate()` models lag, noise, slip and the firmware ramp.
- Setup on the official floor: automatic from the 4 floor markers (Enter when all are found), or
  C → click 2 points per side in the order SOUTH, EAST, NORTH, WEST (refuses a mirrored order).
  No tape clicks (the map is exact; `USE_LIVE_TAPE` is off: on a practice floor without taped
  bays, the block tape would close them). `CAM_HEIGHT_MM` (measured) pins the focal length,
  which matters for an overhead webcam.
- A live keep-out monitor warns if the robot outline is > 5 mm over a lane edge. `--record`
  logs the official pose, the goal, keep-out frames and arrival errors.
- **Tested in simulation only**:
  - `lane_follow` self-test + stress test: 720 random legs (3 setups: CAD size, max 15 x 15,
    bad camera/Wi-Fi), 0 failures, stops ≤ 2.3 cm (3.6 cm with the bad camera).
  - Keep-out: 0.1 cm (CAD size) / 1.0 cm (15 x 15). The remaining touch is turning at a T-junction
    against the outer edge, which no software can avoid for a 15 x 15 robot.
  - End-to-end (scratchpad `sim_official.py`): rendered webcam 2.5 m up, 0.8 m outside the south
    edge. Setup → H → S2 → DZ → S5 → P3 through the real `setup()` / `run()` and a fake ESP32.
    Camera height estimated 2.50 m (true 2.50), stops 0.5-0.9 cm, docking heading ≤ 0.7°, true
    keep-out max 0.1 cm.
- The bug review (8-agent workflow) found 5 real defects, all fixed: the focal estimate for
  centred / overhead views (now least squares + overhead fallback), the `need` floor, an H-test
  turn over 180°, setup with an unusable layout, and the setup window too big for 1366×768.
- Second review (8 agents, 2026-10-07): 14 confirmed findings (9 distinct), all fixed:
  - CRITICAL: with CAM_HEIGHT_MM, height(f) is not monotonic for a side view, so the wrong root
    shifted every pose by up to 17 cm. Now all roots are found and the one nearest the
    rectangle's own focal estimate is used.
  - The floor markers were bunched in the middle (moved out).
  - The marker sheets had uneven borders: centring the sheet put the black square 7.5 mm off.
    Borders are now symmetric.
  - Off-lane sideways stub; 180° turns mid-lane / on the dock (now via-junction planning).
  - Turn limit cycle at ≥ 0.27 s delay (now pulses).
  - A robot in a bay facing out was forced to turn round in the bay.
  - `keepout_depth` over-reported at bay ends.
  - Stray setup clicks became side points; SPACE re-planned from a stale pose.
- After the fixes (simulation):
  - delay 0.13-0.5 s: 0 failures, stops ≤ 1.2 cm
  - 540 random legs: 0 failures, stops ≤ 2 cm, keep-out 0.0 cm (CAD size) / 0.8 cm (15 x 15, at a
    bay mouth against the outer edge: geometric)
  - end-to-end practice floor: stops 0.2-0.9 cm, true keep-out 0.0 cm.
- **Firmware reviewed 2026-10-07: no change needed for the lane driving** (OTA was added later that
  day at the owner's request; see section 5). Same 8-byte DR protocol and 300 ms fail-safe
  (the laptop sends ≥ 20 Hz); ASSIST stays off (it would fight the follower's steering). Compiles
  with esp32 core 3.3.8 (77 % flash) using the IDE's bundled arduino-cli. Simulated with the
  firmware's 1200 PWM/s ramp from 0 versus a proposed "start the ramp at 90": no measurable
  difference, so it was not changed. Stops coast (IN1 = IN2 = LOW); short-brake (both HIGH) is
  a possible later tweak if real stops overshoot.

## 10b. Arena mode (newer version) — `laptop/arena_drive.py`

The owner moved to a **USB webcam on a Windows PC** with a side view of the whole arena (tape
lines on the floor); the robot must drive **between the lines**. The iPhone / `follow_tape.py`
setup is kept but no longer the main path. Firmware unchanged (same 8-byte `DR` UDP packets).
(This "roam between the lines" mode is now the R key / `OFFICIAL = False`; see 10a.)

- **Robot position**: ArUco marker (`DICT_4X4_50`, id 0, `--make-tag`) flat on the top plate.
  Needs a white border ≥ 1/6 of the black square. Found in the arena crop at 1x then 2x, and
  in a crop around the last position (enlarged to ~80 px).
- **Setup** (`--setup --arena-w --arena-h`): click 2 points on EACH side of the red rectangle
  (8 clicks, going round; side 1 = arena-w). The corners are where the lines meet, so they may be
  off-screen (they are, in the owner's photos). Then click the tape (robot out of the arena), black
  AND red → `arena_calib.json` + `arena_tape_map.png`. The final preview draws the arena and the
  measured blocks over the camera picture: they must sit on the tape.
- **Measured layout** (`RING_MM`, `GAP_MM` at the top of the file; still None = not measured yet).
  The map is drawn from the numbers with the 4 blocks SOLID, and live tape detection only adds
  extras (e.g. a ball). Recommended: the reflections leave gaps in the detected tape.
  The webcam's focal length and position are computed from the corners alone. They are used
  to correct the marker's height parallax (marker ~14 cm up looks ~30 cm off from a side view).
  A field of view outside 50–100° gives a warning (usually swapped arena-w / arena-h).
- **Heading test** (`H`, once after setup): still → forward → still → right turn → still.
  It learns marker→robot-front offset and `turn_sign` (catches swapped left/right motors).
  SPACE refuses to start until it has been done.
- **Tape**: colour from the clicks (only the least floor-like pixels around each click). Black
  and coloured clicks get separate ranges; black = V ≤ min(p95 + 25, 0.33 × floor V), which keeps
  out the grout lines. Checked in the full-res camera picture, then warped to a 5 mm/px top-down
  map, then open 3×3 (removes grout and specks) and close 5×5 (joins tape broken by reflections).
  Live tape is OR-ed with the saved map. The robot's own body (and the floor it hides) is masked
  out of the live part.
- **Steering**: distance transform of the map. Each frame it tries directions −90..+90° and
  scores each by room along 300 mm (capped), minus turn / change-of-mind costs. It steers with
  PD and pivots if > 55° off; STUCK = turn on the spot. Stops if the marker is unseen > 0.3 s
  or the camera freezes.
- Tunables at the top of the file: `BASE_SPEED 140`, `KP 1.0`, `KD 0.05`, `PIVOT_DEG 55`,
  `NEED_MM` (= half robot width + 10), `LOOK_MM 300`, `TAG_HEIGHT_MM 141.5` (measure!), `CAM_W/H 1920x1080`.
- `--record` → `laptop/runs/arena-<date-time>/` (summary.txt, log.csv, frames).
- **Tested only in simulation** (rendered side-view webcam, red-tape loop lane 300 mm wide,
  simulated robot with lag, fake UDP robot, scripted keys). Results:
  - 1080p 1.1 m up / 1.3 m in front, and 720p 1.6 m up: 4 laps per minute, robot centre always
    ≥ 99 mm from tape.
  - 720p low side view: the marker is too small at the far edge → robot stops safely.
  - Not run with a real webcam or robot yet.

### Real arena (owner's webcam photos, `WIN_20261006_*.jpg` in the folder above `pickup-bot/`)
Glossy white 600 mm(?) tiles with dark grout lines. Thin red/orange tape outer rectangle. Inside it,
4 square blocks of black tape (2×2), so the corridors are a ring around the blocks plus a cross
between them. The shape is fixed; the webcam position is not decided yet. Ceiling-light reflections
cross the tape.
- From one photo (assuming a 3 × 3 m arena): corridors ≈ 215–230 mm wide, against a 150 mm
  robot. Little room for error.
- Tape pipeline on the real photo: grout rejected, black tape found (a few gaps at reflections),
  far red tape mostly too faint (fine: the arena edge counts as a wall). The guessed symmetric
  layout (ring 230, gap 215) lines up with the black tape in the overlay.
- **Camera placement is the main risk.** Simulated real layout (scratchpad `sim_real.py`):
  - webcam about 1.15 m up just outside the near edge (like the photos): the far half is about
    4 m away, the marker is about 16 × 4 px and unreadable, so the robot stops. A 134 mm marker
    alone or a 2 m webcam alone are still not enough.
  - **webcam 2 m up + 134 mm marker** (biggest that fits the top plate): drove 15.7 m in 60 s,
    covered most of the arena, marker lost 6 frames, closest centre-to-tape 86 mm (half-width
    75): it never touched tape.
  - Rerun 2026-10-07 (the first runs were killed for low memory): webcam 2.5 m up + normal marker
    drove 15.6 m per minute (min 91 mm); colour-only mode at 2 m + big marker drove 15.7 m
    (min 90 mm, no false tape).

### Next steps (2026-10-07)
1. Owner: print the markers (`--make-tag`): robot marker ~130 mm square, floor markers ~150 mm
   black, with the CENTRE OF THE BLACK SQUARE at the printed positions (the 2026-10-07 positions
   near the block corners). Mount the webcam (~2.5 m), measure CAM_HEIGHT_MM (essential if
   overhead) and TAG_HEIGHT_MM, run `--setup`, H, then try goal keys on the real floor with
   `--record`. Practice floor: CUTOUTS = False (bay goals stop in front of the bay).
2. (done) S3 / S4 alcove sides checked against Figure 1 (`arenaimg.jpg`).
3. Lens-distortion correction (webcam barrel distortion at the edges may be several cm). With
   only 2.5 cm of lane margin this is likely the next accuracy limit.
4. Then the fleet: 3 marker ids, a lane-reservation / deadlock-free planner on the arena_spec
   graph, a WMS client + mock WMS, QR reading, telemetry, dashboard.

## 11. Working with the owner
- He usually wants **complete, paste-ready files** (not diffs) plus short numbered steps.
- Keep code beginner-readable with comments; never change wiring without saying so clearly —
  **the wiring in section 3 is final**.
- Always keep the motor fail-safes.
- 3D parts → OBJ files for Bambu Studio.
- He's on a Mac (Terminal, Arduino IDE). The arena-mode PC is Windows (`py` / `python`, COM ports).
